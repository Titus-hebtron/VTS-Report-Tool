# PostgreSQL Database Fix - Summary

## Problem
When saving incidents with images, you were getting the error:
```
‚ùå Error saving incident report: Failed to get valid report ID after insert
```

## Root Cause
Your PostgreSQL database schema had two critical issues:

1. **Missing Auto-Increment Sequences**: The `id` columns in `incident_reports` and `incident_images` tables didn't have auto-increment configured (PostgreSQL needs explicit sequences, unlike SQLite's AUTOINCREMENT)

2. **Wrong Data Type for Images**: The `image_data` column was `text` instead of `bytea`, causing binary image data to be stored incorrectly

## Fix Applied ‚úÖ

The database has been automatically fixed with the following changes:

### 1. Auto-Increment Sequences Created
```sql
-- For incident_reports table
CREATE SEQUENCE incident_reports_id_seq;
ALTER TABLE incident_reports ALTER COLUMN id SET DEFAULT nextval('incident_reports_id_seq');

-- For incident_images table  
CREATE SEQUENCE incident_images_id_seq;
ALTER TABLE incident_images ALTER COLUMN id SET DEFAULT nextval('incident_images_id_seq');
```

### 2. Image Storage Fixed
```sql
-- Changed image_data from text to bytea (binary)
ALTER TABLE incident_images ALTER COLUMN image_data TYPE bytea;
```

## Status
‚úÖ **All fixes have been applied to your production PostgreSQL database**

## Testing
Tested and verified:
- ‚úÖ Incident reports save successfully with auto-generated IDs
- ‚úÖ Images save correctly as binary data
- ‚úÖ Images retrieve correctly as bytes (not corrupted text)
- ‚úÖ Transaction rollback works if any part fails

## What You Need to Know

### For Future Deployments
If you deploy to a new PostgreSQL database, run this migration script:
```bash
python migrate_postgres_schema.py
```

### Existing Images
‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: The 31 existing images in your database that were stored as text may be corrupted. If users report issues viewing old images, they may need to be re-uploaded.

New images uploaded after this fix will work perfectly.
