### Unified Idle/Parking Analyzer

1. Select "Idle Time Analyzer" from the sidebar
2. **System automatically detects file format** based on column structure:
   - **Wizpro format**: Detected by "Status" and "Stop position" columns
   - **Paschal format**: Detected by "Stop Duration" and "Address" columns
   - **HTML files**: Automatically detected and parsed for both Wizpro and Paschal formats (GPS systems sometimes export HTML with .xls extension)
3. Upload Excel file (.xls/.xlsx) or HTML file - no manual format selection needed
4. **Automatic processing**:
   - Wizpro: Scans for "Status" column (with various naming variations), filters only "stopped" records, uses corresponding "Stop Position" data for location_address
   - Paschal: Maps "Stop Duration" â†’ `idle_duration_min` (parses formats like "1h42m49s"), "Address" â†’ `location_address`
   - HTML: Parses table data for idle records, identifying column headers by name with Wizpro detection prioritized over Paschal
   - **HTML Address Parsing**: Extracts coordinates from Google Maps URLs (`q=-1.275198,36.812071`) and addresses from after `</a> - ` pattern
   - **Vehicle identification**: Saves extracted vehicle names for data tracking
   - **Debugging**: Shows available status values and filtering results for troubleshooting
   - **Format Detection**: Wizpro indicators ('wizpro', 'stopped', 'stop position') checked before Paschal indicators
   - **Coordinate Extraction**: Automatically parses latitude/longitude from HTML-formatted location data
5. View extracted records in clean table format
6. Save all data to unified database table (filtered by your contractor)
7. Download results as CSV

   - Vehicle summary with total idle minutes and record counts for your contractor
   - Information about how many unique vehicles have data
7. After reviewing the preview, click "ðŸ“¥ Download Full Monthly Report" to generate the complete Excel file
8. The system generates an Excel file with separate sheets for each vehicle that has data in that custom month
9. Sheet names are automatically created from normalized license plates (e.g., "KDK825Y", "KDG320Z")
